    <h2>Energy Olympics!</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are a lightbulb. How much power do you think it'll take you to supply light for a week without stopping? First off, what even <i>is</i> power? </p>
    <p>In physics, power is the amount of work you do over a certain amount of time. It is typically measured in Watts, which is also used to measure the power usage of a lightbulb.</p>
    <p>The amount of power you'll need depends on the type of lightbulb ou are. You may have heard of terms like "LED" or "60-Watt Incandescent," but do you know what they mean? In this game we're going to find out!</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Collecting data</h2>
  <p>First, you're going to do some exercise. Grab a stopwatch - we're going to record some values to figure out how much exercise you would have to do if you were a lightbulb!</p>

      <p>Are you tired? Well, we're about to find out how tired a lightbulb is going to be.</p>

      <p>First, choose a type of lightbulb to step into the shoes of. You might not know what these types mean yet, but that's what you're going to find out.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Design a Marathon</h2>

      <p>Now, drag and drop icons representing each activity - stair climbing, sprinting, or hurdles - to design a marathon for your lightbulb. When the amount of power you've used in your marathon gets close to the amount of power the lightbulb needs, a submit button will appear. Click that when you're done.</p>
