    <p>Imagine you are a lightbulb. How much power do you think it'll take you to supply light for a week without stopping? First off, what even <i>is</i> power? </p>
    <p>In physics, power is the amount of work you do over a certain amount of time. It is typically measured in Watts, which is also used to measure the power usage of a lightbulb.</p>
    <p>The amount of power you'll need depends on the type of lightbulb ou are. You may have heard of terms like "LED" or "60-Watt Incandescent," but do you know what they mean? In this game we're going to find out!</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Collecting data</h2>
  <p>First, you're going to do some exercise. Grab a stopwatch - we're going to record some values to figure out how much exercise you would have to do if you were a lightbulb!</p>

      <p>Now, drag and drop icons representing each activity - stair climbing, sprinting, or hurdles - to design a marathon for your lightbulb. When the amount of power you've used in your marathon gets close to the amount of power the lightbulb needs, a submit button will appear. Click that when you're done.</p>

    <div id="results"></div>
    <p>In order to provide power for a full week. Phew! Aren't you glad you're not a lightbulb?</p>

  <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
  <p>Depending on the type of lightbulb you selected, you may have had to do more or less work. For the 8W LED,
    you probably didn't have to drag too many activities into your marathon, but if you selected the 60W Incandescent,
    you probably filled up a full page! This means that the higher wattage your lightbulbs have, the more power it takes
    for them to light up your home - and the more tired they'll be at the end of it all.
  </p>

  <p>There are three main types of lightbulbs: LED, CFL, and incandescent.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h3>LED - Light Emitting Diode</h3>
      <p>LED lightbulbs have the lowest wattage, typically using less than 12 Watts or 0.012 kilowatt hours (kWh), or the
        fraction of 1,000 Watts used in one hour. These lightbulbs also have the longest lifespan and are the most efficient
        energy users. If you're planning on buying a new lightbulb, these lightbulbs are the type you want to get to 
        save energy - and money!

    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h3>CFL - Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb</h3>
      <p>CFL Lightbulbs, characterized by their spiral structure, have the second lowest wattage, using between 13 and 20 Watts 
        or 0.013 and 0.02 kWh. These Lightbulbs can shine as brightly as an LED, but they aren't as efficient and use more 
        energy to do so. They don't save as much power or money as an LED would, but they are much more effcient than the 
        incandescent lightbulbs.

    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h3>Incandescent lightbulb</h3>
      <p>Incandescent lightbulbs, as you can tell from the picture, are much older, and have a wattage of over 40 Watts or 0.04 kWh.
        They are the least energy-efficient type of lightbulbs and only convert 5% of the energy they use into visible light. The
        rest of the energy is converted into heat, meaning that these lightbulbs can become very, very hot. They also have the 
        shortest lifespans out of any other lightbulb, meaning that you will have to replace them a lot more often!
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As you can tell, LED lightbulbs are the most efficient of the three types. The next time you're out to buy lightbulbs,
    keep this in mind - you'll want to pick the lightbulb that requires the least power to light your home, so as not to
    tire them out!
  </p>

  <p>If you want to see how much a difference wattage makes, feel free to play again, choosing a different lightbulb
    as the type you selected before. You may be surprised!
